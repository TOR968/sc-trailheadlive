<b>Demos for Trailhead Live sessions</b>

For Visualforce the files are just text files with the source code for the Visualforce pages and - if using a custom controller or controller extension - the Apex classes. To use just create your own Visualforce page and copy/paste.

The LWC demos are in a format suitable for adding directly into a MS VS Code project.
